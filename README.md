**SQL Challenge Summary: Organizing Pewlett Hackard's Employee Database**

**Project Objective**
The goal of this project was to systematically organize the vast employee database of Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s using PostgreSQL, enhancing data retrieval and management.

**Detailed Project Description**
- **Data Provision**: The data for this project was sourced from six different CSV files, which were located in the Resources folder of this repository. These files provided comprehensive details about:
  - Department Information
  - Job Titles
  - Employee Information
  - Salary Details
  - Employee Assignments by Department
  - Department Managers
- **Database Design**: An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was developed with Quick DBD to visualize the database structure. This diagram outlined all data types, keys, relationships, and constraints integral to the database design.
- **Database Schema**: The schema for the database tables was defined in a SQL file. This schema outlined the creation of tables and the import process of CSV files using pgAdmin.
- **Analysis and Queries**: Once the database was established, various SQL queries were executed to analyze the data. These queries facilitated a deeper understanding of the organizational structure and employee details.

**Resources and Outputs**
- All SQL files and image files related to the database and ERD are stored in the EmployeeSQL folder of this repository.
- The project effectively structured the legacy data of Pewlett Hackard, making it accessible and manageable through well-defined queries and database schematics.
